Development of a website is required for my online business as I am a developer. The website may include all my professional information and my projects. It should be highly attractive with lots of animations, transitions, sliders and anything else that makes it attractive. It contains my social media accounts that are professional and there should be a complete process of how can anyone place the order and place their complete ideas that are required for their project. Must include my complete portfolio. Must have the option that the client can review and rate me. Have the option that the client can place all the details of the project on the website and confirmation can be done that I will do it or not. The payment method should be on the website. If any company wants to hire me, they can easily access me through my website and can see all my professional work and information.
